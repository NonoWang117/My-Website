        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Charity Water works to bring clean, safe drinking water to remote communities. We partner with local organizations to build wells, provide water
            purification solutions, and train community members to maintain systems so projects remain sustainable. Every donation helps children attend school,
            improves family health, and strengthens the future of entire communities.

                    Amina used to walk miles every day to collect water for her family. Thanks to community-funded projects, her village now has a
                    reliable well. Amina can attend school and her family enjoys better health and more time for work and play.
